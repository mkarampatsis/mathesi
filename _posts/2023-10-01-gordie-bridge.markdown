Mathesi was commissioned to develop the predictive monitoring system for the bridge, with the purpose of predicting extreme climatic conditions that might hinder the operation of the bridge and place motorists at risk. The system was benchmarked against past climatic events on other bridges and found to be highly accurate in predicting extremes. The system has been integrated in the bridge's full monitoring system, which will be operational upon the bridge's opening planned for 2025.
